This project aims to create a musical sequencer using minimal components, centered around the ATMega328p microcontroller. Output is generated through PWM signals, with WS2812 LEDs serving to indicate events and data. Control is facilitated by eight buttons and two shift buttons, allowing for step selection and parameter adjustments including start offset, pitch, and length. Playback relies on program memory, eliminating the need for external memory during operation.
